## What's New (User Facing)
 * Created a simple add class feature that lets the user add any ammount of classes they are taking. On top of that it lets the user delete the class via the 3 sideways dots. Those dots serve as a settings for each class. This will house some more features we plan to exicute in the next sprint. - Andres Sanchez 
 * Created a simple class grade average calculation that provides a class grade based on graded assignments - Arni Thorvaldsson
 * Created an option to add due dates when adding assignments. Also added an upcoming assignments display on the dashboard showing the next week of assignments sorted by earliest due. Also added a check mark next to upcoming assignments and other assignments to check them off to be done. - Kaiyu Adachi
 * Created an add a new assignment grade and edit an existing assignment grade  - Tony Cao

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

* During this sprint, I focused on implementing the automatic grade average calculation feature for each class in the Grade Tracker. This involved integrating assignment-level grade data with the class-level view to compute real-time averages whenever grades were added or updated. I collaborated with the team to ensure the feature aligned with our existing data structure and UI design. Along the way, I resolved issues with state updates and data flow between components, which improved my understanding of React hooks and modular component communication.

## Unfinished Work
THere were a few features/issues that we did not get to or did not complete this sprint that we originally wanted to. This includes a circle graph which would depict grading based on weight of the type of assignment. The circle graph will also show the current grade for the class serving as a nice visual. This was in progress however other features were more important and prioritized with our time. The other two features that did not even get in progress were deploying service to the cloud and updating UI. Deploying service to the cloud would have been nice but it is low priority and is not super important as of sprint 2 for our web apps funcionality. Updating the UI is something we want to do overtime, but how pretty the web app looks is not as important as if the web app even works. Functionality comes before looks, so it is most likely something we will update over time slowly or a last sprint type of feature.
