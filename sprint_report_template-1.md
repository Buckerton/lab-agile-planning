## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team.

* This sprint we got the basic login, forgot password , registration system and dark mode working for our grade tracker and learned a lot about how to actually build features as a team. We set up the pages for login, registration, forgot password feature and a simple dashboard, and figured out how to save multiple user accounts in local storage since we don’t have a backend yet. One of the harder parts was just getting used to Git — we had some confusion at first but we worked it out by sticking to branches and pull requests so nothing got lost. Overall, we came away with a better understanding of how to break tasks down, how to connect our code together, and how important communication is for making progress as a group.

//NOTE FOR WORK SUMMARY: Merge everyones accomplishments into one paragraph instead of all being seperated ^^^^^ ***IMPORTANT

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Item 1: We knew what we wanted to do
  * Item 2: We met together and easily decided what we would all work on individually
  * Item 3: Foundational issues that we worked on went well and developed smoothly with little to no problems
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Item 1: Using the discord Kanban Board we wasnt aware we needed to create user stories for everysingle thing we did hence why they werent created until recently
   * Item 2: Holding a Planning Poker Meeting to estimate user stories relatively
   * Item 3: Working on more issues and developing more functionalities 
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Item 1: Using Kanban board
   * Item 2: Holding a Planning Poker Meeting to estimate user stories relatively
   * Item 3: Working on more issues and developing more functionalities
